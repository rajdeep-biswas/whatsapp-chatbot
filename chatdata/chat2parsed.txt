You can check the codes as well?
Not open source
But I really loved a very simple but useful feature
Oh , so they are user friendly
I'll have to download a different copy
It'll take hours
I'll study or something
You work, I will just come and hug you and leave again
come come
Yeah just brief them
I got any work to do?
Ofcourse
variable is literally the stuff they teach you in day 0 of programming
this took two days apparently xD
passed at first attempt
i only listened to the lectures halfass
That's tremendous
actually i got half of the last question wrong, not even completely
Yeah yeah sure
then i had to cheat
But still
I have decided to write directly to the education/HR ministry of India
and any teacher's cell you found?
No legal action can be taken and rn the  state govt is too busy to address this issue
and talk to some people you visually find helpful
you can make a post in the group too if you want to
this dude looks legit
This looks approachable
Okay I will write here first then
And then see what people suggest
you can message some of the members first
i guess
but upto you
Here people have similar issues
Alright. I got many threads now. Thanks bhai
I had been speaking to people
if i'm making a reddit post should i mention the name of your school
Yeah of course
I am individually texting some people in fb
did i miss anything?
the writing is too congested isnt it
should i paragraph it
The school doesn't give incentives to sell ipads. Is that  okay to mention?
like for every ipad sold
you get some bonus
ah fuck
To which he said, it's a legal matter, consult a lawyer
its actually not, he doesnt get it :/
yeah yeah i updated
okay okay take it slow
try to make it more accurate and more sympathetic, if you want
This sounds correct
Will I be able to see if people comment on your post?
of course
i'll tell you
you dont have to check every two minutes
I will keep checking
i get notifs
Oh okay
yeah and add once they ask
my assumption
just a suggestion
do what you feel is correct
We can't hide anything because we need correct suggestions
I saw glimpses of them
I was waiting eta kokhon bolbi
It's just another rewatch for me no
You should watch it soon
While i still have the vibes
Our conversation got recorded
You downloaded?
I read the contract
i mean it does make you feel better about sloke and worse about me
even sloke doesn't clearly remember
Tbh, I don't know how to feel about it
That's okay
I understand
Selected the text and underlined
that is app specific, if you copy the text outside the app, it wont carry the underlines
Oh fuck
Makes it grammatically correct but then it's the writer's choice
Cooper from 5D conveying coordinates to cooper on earth
Why you think he did it
I don't know
Like coop2 could see what coop1 was doing, so was it that both existed at the same time?
I don't understand the timeline
I understand the purpose
1. You cant time travel to past, as od yet
Reality is brand described
Time and squeeze and stretch but it simply cant run backwards
Yeah, eta I guess they mention in the movie also
Cooper tells his daughter na that when he gets back they will check both the watch
How does a watch function outside earth?
And how would know the difference between the time by their watches?
it just shows earth time
as if he were on earth
Like 60secs=1 minute remains same?
yes yes
coop didn't take that to serve utility
but when you're experiencing time dilation, the watch slows down too, right
So shudhu eta dekhe they would know the time gap?
from an outsider's perception
Yeah
so that was the entire point of them comparing the times
This is time dilation , right?
if coop traveled near light speed for a few minutes, then it would be off by some milliseconds (which we actually already have irl)
(or near a blackhole)
if he traveled the same in for a few days then day would have the difference in hhmmsss
the movie had it huge, so i said this
obviously the hhmmss will still be in place
now every normie is gonna think i stole the name from something that everyone is watching
You can mention it isn't so as a note
although the irl part guy did neither of the two that this movie did
The concept
time dilation?
Yeah, the realtive difference part
Can't see more than this
its loading
but i'll tell you
the "how / why" it works part
its a lot of math
that's why Einstein is called the smartest
So time dilation involves theory of relativity?
his theories time space, time and gravity together
involves = completely based on
Ohh okay
he actually has longer
oh oh my fucking god
mind = blown
Blow mine too
How do you gain time?
if it doesn't make sense come back to me
ignore the equation, just the idea
time dilation is a hacky way of executing forward time travel
you know ISS and the GPS satellites had to be coded / accounted for time dilation so their clocks match up with earth
and every satellite thereof that involve time synchronization (i.e most orbital satellites)
but GPS is the most easy / common example for everyday people
man i'd love to take a look at how it was programmed
I am too dumb to understand this I think
c = lightspeed
Oi how the ball gains speed of the train
But even the one who made the post doesn't understand how that can used as an example for velocity causing time dilation
i think you just read the question xD
this is a question answer forum
that's the entire point lol, you scroll down for the answers
not a post
so first you need to understand that space and time are related
and just believe it does
because that would actually take a fuck load of math and Einstein to prove
So since wormhole e space gets bent, that causes time to bend as well? And hence the time dilation?
it's a door across spacetime
the only two things that can dilate time is gravity and speed
so imagine this if you were to take a door from birpara to malbazar
it reduced the distance to zero (space)
but it still took two hours to get through (time)
that wouldn't make sense right that's normal travel
and it also breaks physics if space was 0 and time didn't change
Exactly my question
so it only make sense that time will also have to change
so while you got here, the wormhole bends both space AND time
We look for a door to reduce space so that we can save time, right?
reduce space AND time :)
its causation, not correlation
if you are bending space you also will by default bend time
Yes
it's actually a good question, it'll give you a better intuition
first question er uttor; yes. but no time dilation is this scenario
you didn't have to travel fast at all
you just got transported, it had nothing to do with your speed
in*
and it's FTL
Is portal a wormhole?
YES
just different literatures
Yeah
?
it's actually called an Einstein-Rosenberg bridge
faster than light (travel)
Rosen* lol not berg
And that happens automatically once you enter a wormhole?
yes but what i mean it does get you FASTER from x to y THAN LIGHT would but you didn't actually travel faster at all, let alone faster than light
or even near light speed
Oh okay okay
its hacks
real life = near light speed possible (tao hypothetical* xD)
which would cause time dilation
speculation = wormhole; excluding the concept of "travel" entirely
you just hack from one place to another
Yeah I get the idea now
(teleporters however are different concept, reminds me, ota for another time)
Oh my next question was so we get teleported ? XD
XD
so you know the now that wormholes are actually a side effective at avoiding time dilation
Yes
in interstellar, they lost two years in traveling from earth to saturn (not the wormhole)
I got a rough idea about it if not entirely, that's okay, right?
(i havent arrived at time dilation yet, this was all answering your wormhole question)
Whats there in a wormhole that causes bending of space?
ahhhh
hacks
no one knows, they're hypothetical, i told you
Oh yes yes
Yeah now time dilation part
btw teleportation is actually way less scientific than wormholes
maane seems more doable, but our real science (GR and SR) is the foundation of wormholes
Teleportation is hypothetical as well na?
general, special relativity
actually, if you're being pedantic
teleporters are actually hypothetical
but wormholes have been theorized, they're now speculations
Wow , so it's close to being a fact nowâ™¥
no no dont think of it as literal progression
i'm just describing the strength of the words
you'd actually see people throwing in their "theories"
being pedantic, its just their hypothesis
Umm okay
Now tell me this
I think I got you deviated
yeah just telling you that don't think it's a ladder that everything science climbs up
I got that
so where did we leave it
time and space are connected right
Yeah
they're not independent of each other
Yes
so imagine i'm at earth and you're in a spacecraft zooming past earth real fast
I mean  I was waiting
You are earth
so we're considering the duration of 1 second that you're shooting by earth
you observe that i have moved some 1000 kms (in space)
but i have observed that i have moved 0 kms (in space)
so according to you, i must have moved differently in time as well, since i moved differently in space
and also the other way around
don't make the system THAT complicated
i'm stationary in the universe
you're moving
Since time and space are related?
that is the literal meaning "relate"ivity
"time is relative"
not absolute
Yes yes
and another example, if you were walking across the street, you'd notice i moved a few meters
and i'd still say i didnt move at all
and that difference in the distance covered has only one factor; speed
From my perspective , right?
so the faster you go the more time dilation you experience
yes, and in this case there is time dilation as well but ridiculously small; negligible
Why speed
s = d/t right
Okay, that way, yes
in your own reference point time is constant
and the distance your covering changes
Yeah
my point was that this is how speed (and velocity) causes time dilation
and it's contrary; if you're moving faster than i; you're slowing down for me and i am speeding up for you
if we're both spacefaring but traveling at the same speed, we age the same
relative to each other
but age lesser than people on earth
Like when we are traveling and the stationary things move past us?
it doesn't have to move past you, you could do the same thing somewhere far away
Yeah but the understanding of the concept bolchi
i involved the moving "past you" so that you can make sense of how "observations" are made
yes yes
that stackexchange answer was really good
How ironic: "stationary" things "moving" past me
lol
also, how you mentioned me moving round the sun
technically, nothing in the universe is stationary
it's all reference points that make things stationary
I need to read it again, it will make more sense to  me now
yes
Exactly
oh so gravity bends spacetime itself
its so intuitive
goddamnit einstein
what was he made of
He made better use of his grey matter
its crazy how outdated shit we are taught in school
newton's law isn't even accurate janish toh
the F = g m m / r^2
it's been superseded by einstein's GR
It's not F= mg , anymore?
but it continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity in most applications. Relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme accuracy, or when dealing with very strong gravitational fields, such as those found near extremely massive and dense objects, or at small distances (such as Mercury's orbit around the Sun).
that's a different context
Under an assumption of constant gravitational attraction, Newton's law of universal gravitation simplifies to F = mg, where m is the mass of the body and g is a constant vector with an average magnitude of 9.81 m/s2 on Earth.
F = mg is only applicable on earth
I knew it was universal,this is new to me
this however is universal but only approximating
Yeah
We had one more thing to discuss
i hadn't even realized that these two were the same equations with the "planetary" distance and earth's mass removed out of the equation
Time as a physical dimension in 5D
If I asked anything that was not written in the book, my doubts got dismissed saying they were unnecessary
And I gradually lost interest
yeah classic
i fucking hated bhatnagar for this
education system is broken
exact reason i got inclined to the internet
i could ask and find out as much as i wanted
limited by everything humans ever knew
yes i was gonna mention with an "if only" :/
